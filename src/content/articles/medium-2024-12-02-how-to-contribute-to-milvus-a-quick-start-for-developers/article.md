[**Milvus**](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus) is an open-source [vector database](https://zilliz.com/learn/what-is-vector-database) designed to manage high-dimensional vector data. Whether you’re building intelligent search engines, recommendation systems, or next-gen AI solutions such as retrieval augmented generation ([RAG](https://zilliz.com/learn/Retrieval-Augmented-Generation)), Milvus is a powerful tool at your fingertips.

But what truly drives Milvus forward isn’t just its advanced technology — it’s the vibrant, passionate [developer community](https://zilliz.com/community) behind it. As an open-source project, Milvus thrives and evolves thanks to the contributions of developers like you. Every bug fix, feature addition, and performance enhancement from the community makes Milvus faster, more scalable, and more reliable.

Whether you’re passionate about open-source, eager to learn, or want to make a lasting impact in AI, Milvus is the perfect place to contribute. This guide will walk you through the process — from setting up your development environment to submitting your first pull request. We’ll also highlight common challenges you might face and provide solutions to overcome them.

Ready to dive in? Let’s make Milvus even better together!

### Setting Up Your Milvus Development Environment

First thing first: setting up your development environment. You can either install Milvus on your local machine or use Docker — both methods are straightforward, but you’ll also need to install a few third-party dependencies to get everything running.

### Building Milvus Locally

If you like building things from scratch, building Milvus on your local machine is a breeze. Milvus makes it easy by bundling all the dependencies in the `install_deps.sh` script. Here’s the quick setup:

```
# Install third-party dependencies.$ cd milvus/$ ./scripts/install_deps.sh# Compile Milvus.$ make
```

### Building Milvus with Docker

If you prefer Docker, there are two ways to go about it: you can either run commands in a pre-built container or spin up a dev container for a more hands-on approach.

```
# Option 1: Run commands in a pre-built Docker container  build/builder.sh make  # Option 2: Spin up a dev container  ./scripts/devcontainer.sh up  docker-compose -f docker-compose-devcontainer.yml ps  docker exec -ti milvus-builder-1 bash  make milvus
```

**Platform Notes:** If you’re on Linux, you’re good to go — compilation issues are pretty rare. However, Mac users, especially with M1 chips, might run into some bumps along the way. Don’t sweat it, though — we have a guide to help you work through the most common issues.

### Common Issues and How to Fix Them

Sometimes, setting up your Milvus development environment doesn’t go as smoothly as planned. Don’t worry — here’s a quick rundown of common issues you might hit and how to fix them fast.

### Homebrew: Unexpected Disconnect While Reading Sideband Packet

If you’re using Homebrew and see an error like this:

```
==> Tapping homebrew/coreremote: Enumerating objects: 1107077, done.remote: Counting objects: 100% (228/228), done.remote: Compressing objects: 100% (157/157), done.error: 545 bytes of body are still expected.44 MiB | 341.00 KiB/sfetch-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packetfatal: early EOFfatal: index-pack failedFailed during: git fetch --force origin refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/mastermyuser~ %
```

**Fix:** Increase the `http.postBuffer` size:

```
git config --global http.postBuffer 1M
```

If you also run into `Brew: command not found` after installing Homebrew, you might need to set up your Git user configuration:

```
git config --global user.email xxxgit config --global user.name xxx
```

### Docker: Error Getting Credentials

When working with Docker, you might see this:

```
error getting credentials - err: exit status 1, out: ``
```

![]()

**Fix:** Open`~/.docker/config.json` and remove the `credsStore` field.

### Python: No Module Named ‘imp’

If Python throws this error, it’s because Python 3.12 removed the `imp` module, which some older dependencies still use.

![]()

**Fix:** Downgrade to Python 3.11:

```
brew install python@3.11
```

### Conan: Unrecognized Arguments or Command Not Found

**Issue:** If you see `Unrecognized arguments: --install-folder conan`, you’re likely using an incompatible Conan version.

![]()

**Fix:** Downgrade to Conan 1.61:

```
pip install conan==1.61
```

**Issue:** If you see `Conan command not found`, it means your Python environment isn’t properly set up.

**Fix:** Add Python’s bin directory to your `PATH`:

```
export PATH="/path/to/python/bin:$PATH"
```

### LLVM: Use of Undeclared Identifier ‘kSecFormatOpenSSL’

This error usually means your LLVM dependencies are outdated.

![]()

**Fix:** Reinstall LLVM 15 and update your environment variables:

```
brew reinstall llvm@15export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@15/lib"export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm@15/include"
```

**Pro Tips**

-   Always double-check your tool versions and dependencies.
-   If something still doesn’t work, the [Milvus GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/issues) is a great place to find answers or ask for help.

### Configuring VS Code for C++ and Go Integration

Getting C++ and Go to work together in VS Code is easier than it sounds. With the right setup, you can streamline your development process for Milvus. Just tweak your `user.settings` file with the configuration below:

```
{   "go.toolsEnvVars": {       "PKG_CONFIG_PATH": "/Users/zilliz/milvus/internal/core/output/lib/pkgconfig:/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib64/pkgconfig",       "LD_LIBRARY_PATH": "/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib:/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib64",       "RPATH": "/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib:/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib64"   },   "go.testEnvVars": {       "PKG_CONFIG_PATH": "/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib/pkgconfig:/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib64/pkgconfig",       "LD_LIBRARY_PATH": "/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib:/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib64",       "RPATH": "/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib:/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib64"   },   "go.buildFlags": [       "-ldflags=-r /Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib"   ],   "terminal.integrated.env.linux": {       "PKG_CONFIG_PATH": "/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib/pkgconfig:/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib64/pkgconfig",       "LD_LIBRARY_PATH": "/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib:/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib64",       "RPATH": "/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib:/Users/zilliz/workspace/milvus/internal/core/output/lib64"   },   "go.useLanguageServer": true,   "gopls": {       "formatting.gofumpt": true   },   "go.formatTool": "gofumpt",   "go.lintTool": "golangci-lint",   "go.testTags": "dynamic",   "go.testTimeout": "10m"}
```

Here’s what this configuration does:

-   **Environment Variables:** Sets up paths for `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and `RPATH`, which are critical for locating libraries during builds and tests.
-   **Go Tools Integration:** Enables Go’s language server (`gopls`) and configures tools like `gofumpt` for formatting and `golangci-lint` for linting.
-   **Testing Setup:** Adds `testTags` and increases the timeout for running tests to 10 minutes.

Once added, this setup ensures a seamless integration between C++ and Go workflows. It’s perfect for building and testing Milvus without constant environment tweaking.

**Pro Tip**

After setting this up, run a quick test build to confirm everything works. If something feels off, double-check the paths and VS Code’s Go extension version.

### Deploying Milvus

Milvus supports [three deployment modes](https://milvus.io/docs/install-overview.md) — **Lite, Standalone,** and **Distributed.**

-   [**Milvus Lite**](https://milvus.io/blog/introducing-milvus-lite.md) is a Python library and an ultra-lightweight version of Milvus. It’s perfect for rapid prototyping in Python or notebook environments and for small-scale local experiments.
-   **Milvus Standalone** is the single-node deployment option for Milvus, using a client-server model. It is the Milvus equivalent of MySQL, while Milvus Lite is like SQLite.
-   **Milvus Distributed** is the distributed mode of Milvus, which is ideal for enterprise users building large-scale vector database systems or vector data platforms.

All these deployments rely on three core components:

-   **Milvus:** The vector database engine that drives all operations.
-   **Etcd:** The metadata engine that manages Milvus’s internal metadata.
-   **MinIO:** The storage engine that ensures data persistence.

When running in **Distributed** mode, Milvus also incorporates **Pulsar** for distributed message processing using a Pub/Sub mechanism, making it scalable for high-throughput environments.

### Milvus Standalone

The Standalone mode is tailored for single-instance setups, making it perfect for testing and small-scale applications. Here’s how to get started:

```
# Deploy Milvus Standalone  sudo docker-compose -f deployments/docker/dev/docker-compose.yml up -d# Start the standalone service  bash ./scripts/start_standalone.sh
```

### Milvus Distributed (previously known as Milvus Cluster)

For larger datasets and higher traffic, the Distributed mode offers horizontal scalability. It combines multiple Milvus instances into a single cohesive system. Deployment is made easy with the **Milvus Operator**, which runs on Kubernetes and manages the entire Milvus stack for you.

Want step-by-step guidance? Check out the [Milvus Installation Guide](https://milvus.io/docs/install_cluster-milvusoperator.md).

### Running End-to-End (E2E) Tests

Once your Milvus deployment is up and running, testing its functionality is a breeze with E2E tests. These tests cover every part of your setup to ensure everything works as expected. Here’s how to run them:

```
# Navigate to the test directory  cd tests/python_client  # Install dependencies  pip install -r requirements.txt  # Run E2E tests  pytest --tags=L0 -n auto
```

For in-depth instructions and troubleshooting tips, refer to the [Milvus Development Guide](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#e2e-tests).

**Pro Tip**

If you’re new to Milvus, start with Milvus Lite or Standalone mode to get a feel for its capabilities before scaling up to Distributed mode for production-level workloads.

### Submitting Your Code

Congrats! You’ve cleared all unit and E2E tests (or debugged and recompiled as needed). While the first build can take some time, future ones will be much faster — so no need to worry. With everything passing, you’re ready to submit your changes and contribute to Milvus!
